# Guess a Number Game
**Android Kotlin Example**

Here is my Android version of the Guess a Number game, which is coded in Kotlin.

This app generates a random number, prompts the user to make a guess, and gives helpful hints after each guess. The user tries to guess the random number that was generated in the least amount of tries.

I have taught my [JavaSwift Academy](https://javaswiftacademy.com/) students how to code this simple app as a way to learn all of the basics of Android development. Feel free to download this Github project and play the game!
